SMF Addin Installer
===================

[InnoSetup][] script to install and activate the
SMF Excel addin.

The [SMF][http://ogres-crypt.com/SMF/] (Stock Market Functions)
add-in adds a number of functions to EXCEL that can allow data
to be extracted and/or retrieved from the
web and placed directly into EXCEL cells or ranges.

The [SMF website][http://ogres-crypt.com/SMF/]
contains the add-in and its supporting files -- documentation,
templates, FAQs, etc.

Questions about the SMF add-in should be directed to
the discussion groups on either
[Yahoo][https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/smf_addin/info]
or [Google][https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/smf-addin].
